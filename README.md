# CMPUT 191 Assignment 3

The goal of the assignment was to examine the concept of purchasing power parity. Similar to the Big Mac index tool that examines the same concept, we created a similar index that instead examines the prices of Red Bull by country.

Let's start by creating a few user defined functions:
![UDFs](1.png "UDFs")

These functions make displaying and scraping tables more efficient, and was the first cell we coded incase we needed to display or scrape multiple tables.

Next we create our tables:
![tables](2.png "tables")
